                        The gateway to Chobe National Park, Kasane is an important point of debarkation for the nearby Victoria
                        Falls in Zimbabwe and Livingstone in Zambia, and Namibia’s Caprivi Strip. Impressive!

                        Spread out along the banks of the Chobe River, Kasane presents an array of hotels, guest 
                        houses and campsites that accommodate all the visitors to the national park. Some are splendidly situated,
                        with wonderful views of the river and its wildlife. Often visitors opt to have a morning game drive and an afternoon boat cruise, 
                        with an afternoon game drive the following day, as this is the time of day when elephants are usually spotted.

                        Another option is a day trip to Victoria Falls, which is about 80 kilometres from Kasane. Kasane now boasts 
                        small shopping malls where all basic commodities can be purchased, and arts and crafts shops. 
                        While its main attraction is the park that lies a mere 10 kilometres away, there are nevertheless attractions in and around the town.

                    <p class="dark">
                        Kasane also boasts an old and dignified Baobab Tree with its own story to 
                        tell. In the early twentieth century the hollowed out centre of the tree 
                        trunk served as the local prison for many years before the current brick 
                        structure behind it was built. A short drive out of Kasane takes you to a 
                        bend in the Chobe River near the Kasane Rapids.Kasane is also popular as a 
                        fishing safari destination. A wide variety of fish species can be found in 
                        the waterways off Kasane including tigerfish and bream. The Sedudu Island 
                        on the Chobe River is also a favorite site for game viewing and bird 
                        watching. See Kasane accommodation.</p>
                        
                        <p>The town lies on the south bank of the 200–300 metres (660–980 ft) wide 
                        Chobe River which forms the border with the extreme tip of 
                        Namibia's Caprivi Strip. The Namibian island of Impalila lies opposite 
                        the town on the north bank of the river, and there is a border crossing 
                        by passenger ferry to Namibia. About 8 kilometres (5 mi) to the east 
                        of Kasane is the village of Kazungula, where Botswana has 1.6 kilometres 
                        (1.0 mi) of frontage to the Zambezi river immediately below its confluence 
                        with the Chobe River. Here the Kazungula border post serves the Kazungula 
                        Ferry crossing to Kazungula in Zambia on the north bank of the Zambezi.
                        Nearby a second border post serves the road into Zimbabwe which runs 70 
                        kilometres (43 mi) east to Victoria Falls. </p>

                        <h3>Description and history</h3>
                        <p>

                            Kasane is well-situated along the Chobe river although you can't always 
                            appreciate the river when passing through the town as most of its frontage 
                            is taken up by various lodges and cannot be seen from the road. Located 5km 
                            or so from the village of Kazungula, where the borders of Botswana, Zimbabwe 
                            and Zambia meet, and just 60km from the Ngoma border, Kasane has become an 
                            important tourist hub in the area. The proximity of the Chobe National Park 
                            means that Kasane is the only town where day trips into a major national park 
                            or game reserve are feasible - as evidenced by the number of game-viewing vehicles 
                            in the town!</p>

                            <h3>Features</h3>

                            <p>

                                
                                
                                The main attraction of Kasane is the Chobe National Park and all of the lodges offer game-drives into the national park although they rarely go much further than Serondela. Boat cruises from the various lodges are special and should not be missed.
                                
                                Day trips to Victoria Falls can be arranged from most of the lodges in the town and this is a hassle-free way of seeing the falls.
                                
                                The Kasane rapids, located near Kazungula, are good for bird watching with specials such as Rock Pratincole seen here. Take care though when walking along the river as crocodiles are common and Elephant and even Buffalo are occasionally seen.
